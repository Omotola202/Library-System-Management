### 2. CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Inserted sample records into the `books` table.
- **Read**: Retrieved and displayed data from various tables.
- **Update**: Updated records in the `employees` table.
- **Delete**: Removed records from the `members` table as needed.

**Task 1. Create a New Book Record**
-- "978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.')"

```sql
INSERT INTO books(isbn, book_title, category, rental_price, status, author, publisher)
VALUES('978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.');
SELECT * FROM books;
```
**Task 2: Update an Existing Member's Address**

```sql
UPDATE members
SET member_address = '125 Oak St'
WHERE member_id = 'C103';
```

**Task 3: Delete a Record from the Issued Status Table**
-- Objective: Delete the record with issued_id = 'IS121' from the issued_status table.

```sql
DELETE FROM issued_status
WHERE   issued_id =   'IS121';
```

**Task 4: Retrieve All Books Issued by a Specific Employee**
-- Objective: Select all books issued by the employee with emp_id = 'E101'.
```sql
SELECT * FROM issued_status
WHERE issued_emp_id = 'E101'
```


**Task 5: List Members Who Have Issued More Than One Book**
-- Objective: Use GROUP BY to find members who have issued more than one book.

```sql
SELECT
    issued_emp_id,
    COUNT(*)
FROM issued_status
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```

### 3. CTAS (Create Table As Select)

- **Task 6: Create Summary Tables**: Used CTAS to generate new tables based on query results - each book and total book_issued_cnt**

```sql
CREATE TABLE book_issued_cnt AS
SELECT b.isbn, b.book_title, COUNT(ist.issued_id) AS issue_count
FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN books as b
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = b.isbn
GROUP BY b.isbn, b.book_title;
```


### 4. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were used to address specific questions:

Task 7. **Retrieve All Books in a Specific Category**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE category = 'Classic';
```

8. **Task 8: Find Total Rental Income by Category**:

```sql
SELECT 
    b.category,
    SUM(b.rental_price),
    COUNT(*)
FROM 
issued_status as ist
JOIN
books as b
ON b.isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn
GROUP BY 1
```

9. **List Members Who Registered in the Last 180 Days**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM members
WHERE reg_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '180 days';
```

10. **List Employees with Their Branch Manager's Name and their branch details**:

```sql
SELECT 
    e1.emp_id,
    e1.emp_name,
    e1.position,
    e1.salary,
    b.*,
    e2.emp_name as manager
FROM employees as e1
JOIN 
branch as b
ON e1.branch_id = b.branch_id    
JOIN
employees as e2
ON e2.emp_id = b.manager_id
```

Task 11. **Create a Table of Books with Rental Price Above a Certain Threshold**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE expensive_books AS
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE rental_price > 7.00;
```

Task 12: **Retrieve the List of Books Not Yet Returned**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issued_status as ist
LEFT JOIN
return_status as rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
WHERE rs.return_id IS NULL;
```

## Advanced SQL Operations

**Task 13: Identify Members with Overdue Books**  
Write a query to identify members who have overdue books (assume a 30-day return period). Display the member's_id, member's name, book title, issue date, and days overdue.

```sql
SELECT 
    ist.issued_member_id,
    m.member_name,
    bk.book_title,
    ist.issued_date,
    -- rs.return_date,
    CURRENT_DATE - ist.issued_date as over_dues_days
FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN 
members as m
    ON m.member_id = ist.issued_member_id
JOIN 
books as bk
ON bk.isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn
LEFT JOIN 
return_status as rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
WHERE 
    rs.return_date IS NULL
    AND
    (CURRENT_DATE - ist.issued_date) > 30
ORDER BY 1
```


**Task 14: Update Book Status on Return**  
Write a query to update the status of books in the books table to "Yes" when they are returned (based on entries in the return_status table).


```sql

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE add_return_records(p_return_id VARCHAR(10), p_issued_id VARCHAR(10), p_book_quality VARCHAR(10))
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$

DECLARE
    v_isbn VARCHAR(50);
    v_book_name VARCHAR(80);
    
BEGIN
    -- all your logic and code
    -- inserting into returns based on users input
    INSERT INTO return_status(return_id, issued_id, return_date, book_quality)
    VALUES
    (p_return_id, p_issued_id, CURRENT_DATE, p_book_quality);

    SELECT 
        issued_book_isbn,
        issued_book_name
        INTO
        v_isbn,
        v_book_name
    FROM issued_status
    WHERE issued_id = p_issued_id;

    UPDATE books
    SET status = 'yes'
    WHERE isbn = v_isbn;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Thank you for returning the book: %', v_book_name;
    
END;
$$


-- Testing FUNCTION add_return_records

issued_id = IS135
ISBN = WHERE isbn = '978-0-307-58837-1'

SELECT * FROM books
WHERE isbn = '978-0-307-58837-1';

SELECT * FROM issued_status
WHERE issued_book_isbn = '978-0-307-58837-1';

SELECT * FROM return_status
WHERE issued_id = 'IS135';

-- calling function 
CALL add_return_records('RS138', 'IS135', 'Good');

-- calling function 
CALL add_return_records('RS148', 'IS140', 'Good');

```




**Task 15: Branch Performance Report**  
Create a query that generates a performance report for each branch, showing the number of books issued, the number of books returned, and the total revenue generated from book rentals.

```sql
CREATE TABLE branch_reports
AS
SELECT 
    b.branch_id,
    b.manager_id,
    COUNT(ist.issued_id) as number_book_issued,
    COUNT(rs.return_id) as number_of_book_return,
    SUM(bk.rental_price) as total_revenue
FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN 
employees as e
ON e.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
JOIN
branch as b
ON e.branch_id = b.branch_id
LEFT JOIN
return_status as rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
JOIN 
books as bk
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = bk.isbn
GROUP BY 1, 2;

SELECT * FROM branch_reports;
```

**Task 16: CTAS: Create a Table of Active Members**  
Use the CREATE TABLE AS (CTAS) statement to create a new table active_members containing members who have issued at least one book in the last 2 months.

```sql

CREATE TABLE active_members
AS
SELECT * FROM members
WHERE member_id IN (SELECT 
                        DISTINCT issued_member_id   
                    FROM issued_status
                    WHERE 
                        issued_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '2 month'
                    )
;

SELECT * FROM active_members;

```


**Task 17: Find Employees with the Most Book Issues Processed**  
Write a query to find the top 3 employees who have processed the most book issues. Display the employee name, number of books processed, and their branch.

```sql
SELECT 
    e.emp_name,
    b.*,
    COUNT(ist.issued_id) as no_book_issued
FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN
employees as e
ON e.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
JOIN
branch as b
ON e.branch_id = b.branch_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
```

**Task 18: Identify Members Issuing High-Risk Books**  
Write a query to identify members who have issued books more than twice with the status "damaged" in the books table. Display the member name, book title, and the number of times they've issued damaged books.    


**Task 19: Stored Procedure**
Objective:
Create a stored procedure to manage the status of books in a library system.
Description:
Write a stored procedure that updates the status of a book in the library based on its issuance. The procedure should function as follows:
The stored procedure should take the book_id as an input parameter.
The procedure should first check if the book is available (status = 'yes').
If the book is available, it should be issued, and the status in the books table should be updated to 'no'.
If the book is not available (status = 'no'), the procedure should return an error message indicating that the book is currently not available.

```sql

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE issue_book(p_issued_id VARCHAR(10), p_issued_member_id VARCHAR(30), p_issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(30), p_issued_emp_id VARCHAR(10))
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$

DECLARE
-- all the variabable
    v_status VARCHAR(10);

BEGIN
-- all the code
    -- checking if book is available 'yes'
    SELECT 
        status 
        INTO
        v_status
    FROM books
    WHERE isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;

    IF v_status = 'yes' THEN

        INSERT INTO issued_status(issued_id, issued_member_id, issued_date, issued_book_isbn, issued_emp_id)
        VALUES
        (p_issued_id, p_issued_member_id, CURRENT_DATE, p_issued_book_isbn, p_issued_emp_id);

        UPDATE books
            SET status = 'no'
        WHERE isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;

        RAISE NOTICE 'Book records added successfully for book isbn : %', p_issued_book_isbn;


    ELSE
        RAISE NOTICE 'Sorry to inform you the book you have requested is unavailable book_isbn: %', p_issued_book_isbn;
    END IF;
END;
$$

-- Testing The function
SELECT * FROM books;
-- "978-0-553-29698-2" -- yes
-- "978-0-375-41398-8" -- no
SELECT * FROM issued_status;

CALL issue_book('IS155', 'C108', '978-0-553-29698-2', 'E104');
CALL issue_book('IS156', 'C108', '978-0-375-41398-8', 'E104');

SELECT * FROM books
WHERE isbn = '978-0-375-41398-8'

```



**Task 20: Create Table As Select (CTAS)**
Objective: Create a CTAS (Create Table As Select) query to identify overdue books and calculate fines.

Description: Write a CTAS query to create a new table that lists each member and the books they have issued but not returned within 30 days. The table should include:
    The number of overdue books.
    The total fines, with each day's fine calculated at $0.50.
    The number of books issued by each member.
    The resulting table should show:
    Member ID
    Number of overdue books
    Total fines
